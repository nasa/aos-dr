-----------------------
### About
AOS-DR is software that performs runtime diagnosis of a system of interest. That is, it can determine when part of the system fails (fault/failure detection) and determine what part failed (fault/failure isolation). This software was first developed as part of the Autonomy Operating System project at NASA Ames Research Center. However, AOS-DR is general software that may be adapted to diagnose any system. The code and documentation will typically only use Diagnostic Reasoner, or DR, as the name of the software. \
\
The software is implemented as an application that runs within Core Flight Executive (cFE). cFE is open-source flight software created by NASA, and maintained separately [here](https://github.com/nasa/cFE). AOS-DR cannot run without being part of the cFE framework. It also currently uses another cFE app called [Limit Checker (LC)](https://github.com/nasa/LC) to classify data from the system into pass/fail results, which are the input to AOS-DR. cFE runs on Linux and VxWorks; however, AOS-DR has only been used on Linux.\
\
AOS-DR uses a dependency matrix (D-matrix) approach for performing diagnosis. The D-matrix is system-specific, and maps pass/fail results into system failure modes. A user of AOS-DR will need to create a D-matrix as well as several other tables in order to adapt it for their system. For more details on how AOS-DR works, please see the user manual in the doc directory.
